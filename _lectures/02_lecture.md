tldr: "We started off by learning about windows cmd.exe commands and bat files. Next, we copied the KeePass and SysInternals tools from flash disk to c:\tools and uncompressed them. We added the c:\tools\KeePass and c:\tools\SystemInteranlsSuite to the system path. Next we created an account on DropBox. We then created a password database using KeePass and stored it on DropBox. At the end we created an account on github.com and forked the sauleh.github.io repository from github.com/sauleh. Next session we will customize the web site to be our own."
