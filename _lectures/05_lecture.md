tldr: "We talked about how to edit your github.io website. Then we had a quick introduction to networking and the internet, starting from the physical layer all the way up to the application layer. In the second half of the class we spent time learning about variables and functions in Python. We ended the class with a homework to build a scalable ascii-art rocket."
