tldr: "After covering the logistics, we continued with the basics of the Python programming language. We spent time on functions, debugging, return values, if statements and while loops. Students wrote code to print all numbers under 100 that are dividable by 3 and 5. We finished the class with an exercise to write a program to check whether a number is prime or not."
